<h3>This page is under some serious construction...</h3>

<hr>
Though I am not all together certain why I am engaging in the process of creating this page, 
I am certain that I have devoted much more time to this endeavor than any time it may, someday, 
return.  Perhaps this can operate as a useful axiom for the use of many technologies 
we utilize in our daily lives in this era.  Whatever the outcome, I have found the process 
enjoyable, and hope that you may find joy, utility, or a chuckle in my modest offering to the 
cybernetic world of organized electric pulses and flows.
