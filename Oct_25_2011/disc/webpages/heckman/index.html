About a year later, Harvey Edwards '78, Tom Westervelt '78, Scott Conti '77, and Rich Lee '77 gave birth to the 'MudSharks', inspired by a Frank Zappa song. Back then, the Mudsharks were a coed team, playing against the only 6 or so collegiate teams that existed. Those teams, Lehigh, Rutgers, Colgate, Dartmouth, and a few others, have all changed their names several times over the years. The Mudsharks maintain the longest running team name in college Ultimate. <P>In the Spring of 1977, the Bucknell Mudsharks went 23-2-1 and were ranked #1 in the National tournament. In spite of their loss to the eventual champions, Penn State, many of those Mudsharks from the late 1970s and early ‘80s, went on to win back-to-back World Ultimate Masters Championships in 1991 and ‘92. <P>Our team prides itself on its spirit and, in many cases, prefers to win the spirit award at a tournament over the tournament itself (The prize is generally cooler). We worship the all-powerful Yoda and have many rituals to bring ourselves into an Ultimate frenzy for tournaments. <P>Another important aspect of our team is our connection to the womens team the <A HREF="http://www.students.bucknell.edu/akenny">Peace Frogs</A> who often attend tournaments with us, as well as practice and party with the Sharks. <P>The current Mudsharks are young and growing, and are trying to attend every tournament possible - simply because we love to play. We hope to see you soon! (See Bucknell World, Nov. ‘91; BU World, Sept. ‘93; Catalyst, May ‘89; Bucknellian, April ‘91; Bucknellian, May ‘92; Bucknellian, April ’96; and the <A HREF="http://www.orgs.bucknell.edu/bucknellian/">Bucknellian</A> often afterward) <P>The Mudsharks and Peacefrogs practice every day on the Mod Fields from 4pm to 6pm. All Bucknell students and faculty are welcome to attend.
