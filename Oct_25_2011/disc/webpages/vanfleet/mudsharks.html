<center><h2>Bucknell Mudsharks Advisor</h2></center>
<hr>
A club advisor has few responsibilities, beyond signing budget requests and travel permission forms.  However, I share an interest in all aspects of frisbee sports with the club teams here at Bucknell.<br>
I have a collection of frisbees to look at if you want to stop by my office, and if you play disc golf on campus, I am the guy that can help you get your frisbee back off the Library roof.<br>
I maintain a file of interesting articles and information about the Bucknell Mudsharks since 1988 (hey, I'm a librarian, OK!)<p>
