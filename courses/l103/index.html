Email is the best and quickest way to contact me if you have any questions.<p>


<b>Office Hours and Location:</b> <br>
11:00-12:30 on Tuesdays  <br>
IU Linguistics Club, 720 E. Atwater Street <p>

Notes:  The office is near the Optometry school, west of the intersection of Woodlawn 
and Atwater.  If this time does not fit your schedule or you would simply like to 
arrange a different time to meet, please email me to set up a mutually agreeable time 
and place.  Also feel free to email me if you have a quick question that you feel 
does not warrant a special meeting.  You can also approach me before or after lecture 
or discussion.  You may also contact Prof. Obeng directly if you wish to meet with 
him.<p>


<b>Course Notes and Studying for Quizzes:</b> I recommend that you visit Prof. 
Obeng's 
course web page.  He is placing his lecture notes on this page, and by reading these 
notes you should be able to get a good indication of what to expect on quizzes and 
tests.  You might also want to print these notes so that you can bring them to class 
to follow the lecture.  Webpage location:<p>

<b>Discussion Section Philosophy</b>: The discussion section is our chance to think 
about 
some of the issues that are brought up in class.  Please come prepared with comments 
and questions.  I expect each student to bring one question to the discussion each 
week.  This can be either something you didn't understand, or a topic you are 
interested in discussing.  

<p>
<b>Grading Policy for Discussion Section</b>: Your attendance and participation in 
weekly 
discussion sections will count towards the overall attendance and participation 
grade.  Small mini-assignments, such as bringing questions to discussion or doing 
short exercises from the textbook, will also count towards this grade.
<p>

For all other course policies, please refer to Professor Obeng's course syllabus on 
his webpage.
