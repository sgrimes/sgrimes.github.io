<center><h2>J111 Course Description</h2></center>

<b>Text:</b><i> Algebra for College Students,2nd. Ed.</i> by Dugopolski.
We
will cover
most of the first six chapters. Although most of the material should be
review, you will find that the course moves very quickly. The attached
syllabus tells which section(s) will be covered in class each day. You
should
read each section before it is discussed in class. 
<p>

<b>Attendance:</b>Daily attendance is required in J111. To avoid being
marked
absent, you should be in your assigned seat on time and stay for the
entire class period. There may be times when you are unable to attend
class due to sickness or other personal problems. For that reason you are
allowed to miss five classes without penalty. If you miss more than five
classes, for any reason, your grade will be reduced one  third (for
example
from a B to a B - ) for each additional class missed, with a maximum
deduction of one full letter grade. 
<p>
<b>Assignments:</b>There will be daily homework assignments that should
take you
approximately one to two hours each to complete. If you find that it is
taking you more than two hours of concentrated work to finish an
assignment, see your instructor or Linda McKinley right away.  Your
homework
will be collected every day and selected problems will be graded. (Some
instructors may choose to give homework quizzes rather than grade
homework papers.) Your homework grade will represent 20 % of your grade in
J111. 
<p>
<b>Exams and Grading:</b> There will be three exams during the semester,
with two
versions of each. All students are required to take the first version
of each exam. If you score below 80 % on the first version of an exam you
will be required to take the second version. If you score 80 % or more on
the first version, you may take the second version to try to improve your
grade. Your instructor will count only the higher of the scores on the two
versions. 
<p><b>  

     Failure to take any required version of an exam will result in a
grade of zero on that version. Exceptions will be made
     only in the case of extreme medical or personal emergencies.
</b>

<p>Your final grade in J111 will be determined by: 
<p>
Homework and quizzes 20% 
<br>
Exam 1                        20% 
<br>
Exam 2                        30% 
<br>
Exam 3                        30% 
<p>The approximate grading scale will be: 
<br>
90 - 100%  A 
<br>
80 - 89%  B 
<br>
75 - 79%  C 
<br>
65 - 74%  D 
<br>
below 64 %  F 
  <br>
<b><p>
                               You must receive a grade of C or better in
J111 in order to move on to J112.

<p>
Extra Help:</b>  In college mathematics classes there is rarely enough
time to
answer 
 everyone's questions during class time. Your instructor will hold 
 regular office hours, and you should plan to use them often. There 
 is also drop - in help available at both Briscoe Quad and Ashton Center 
 every Monday through Thursday night from 7:00 - midnight, and at the 
 Swain East Learning Center (Swain East 340) during the day. If you think 
 that you will need more consistent help in J111, go to Maxwell Hall 221 
 right away to sign up for a regular tutoring session.
