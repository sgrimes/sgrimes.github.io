On a seperate sheet of paper, answer questions 1-7 in the first section
and the two questions in the second section.

<b>Section 1</b><br>

There is a direct relation between the rate of change of a function and
the slope of its lines.

Study the graph to the left. Carlos and  Maria are on their way to school.
On a seperate piece of paper, answer the following questions using
interval notation. (For example, (A,B) would represent all values of t
between A and B.)

<OL><B><li></B>For what values of time (t) are Carlos and Maria stopped? 





<B><li></B>For what values of t do  they increase their speed?





<B><li></B>Which of these increase at the same rate? 



<B><li></B>How does increasing or decreasing speed correspond to the slope
of the line in the graph?

rate?

Consider the diagram below. We are familiar with the
slope of straight lines.  Now, the line y = mx + b can be thought of as
a function of x, like f(x) = mx + b, where y = f(x).  If a function is
decreasing, the line is falling, and the slope is negative.  If a function
is increasing, the line is rising, and the slope is positive. If a
function maintains a constant value, the line is horizontal, and the slope
is 0. What about a vertical line?  What is the slope of a vertical line?
What's your guess about how a function that is a vertical line can be
interpreted?
